# OSX Defaults

A place to centralize the great work [@mathiasbynens](http://mths.be/osx) did gathering and fostering a community around finding and documenting OS X default configuration from the command-line.

## Repo configuration
Note: There are 2 branches.

1. `master`: Reflects http://mths.be/osx at all times. 
2. `suttle`: My personal preferences and settings.


## Executing the .osx file

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

`./.osx`
